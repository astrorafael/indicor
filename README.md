# indicor
An INDI server for [Cristobal Garcia's COR](http://www.observatorioremoto.com/cor/cor.htm)

This server is a skeleton driver that can load device definitions. It needs its child project [pluginscor](https://github.com/astrorafael/pluginscor.git) to dynamically load INDI drivers as shared libraries.
